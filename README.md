# IntegrationServicesProject
Dashboard Backend

This project was built in Visual Studio 2019, using the Microsoft Integration Services Project template. The control flow in the main Package.dtsx contains multiple comments explaining the connections between files and the Microsoft SQL Database server. An image of the schema of the Microsoft SQL Server Database was uploaded on the main folder of this repository called "schema.png".

IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS PROJECT AND RUN IT ON YOUR OWN YOU MUST RECONFIGURE THE CONNECTIONS TO YOUR OWN DATABASE. This is done by just clicking on each DB component in the control flow and choosing a destination Database.
